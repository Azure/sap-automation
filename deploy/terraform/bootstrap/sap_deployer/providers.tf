    <    less than version number
    <=   less than or equal to version number
    ~>   pessimistic constraint operator, constraining both the oldest and newest version allowed.
           For example, ~> 0.9   is equivalent to >= 0.9,   < 1.0 
                        ~> 0.8.4 is equivalent to >= 0.8.4, < 0.9
