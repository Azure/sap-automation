# 1. Design the role 5.5.4.0-cluster one into all the actions upto cluster roles defenition including installation
# 2. create a separate task which has common ASCS profile changes actions which could be used for both sles/rhel
# 3. create os based cluster resources yaml where you actually create the cluster resources

# Clustering commands are based on the Host OS
