# For each supported 'distro_id' we want a list of dictionary entries that
# specify the associated tier (or 'all' to always match), the repository name name
# See the definition of 'distro_full_id' to determine what to use when
# creating an entry for a new distribution.
# For example, XX.Y where XX is the major version and Y is the minor version
