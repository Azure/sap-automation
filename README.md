# Project

The SAP deployment automation framework on Azure is an open-source orchestration tool for deploying, installing and maintaining SAP environments. You can create infrastructure for SAP landscapes based on SAP HANA and NetWeaver with AnyDB on any of the SAP-supported operating system versions and deploy them into any Azure region.

The framework uses Terraform for infrastructure deployment, and Ansible for the operating system and application configuration.
